# Binary tree attribute grammar example
This repository contains a basic example which showcases the capabilities of
attribute grammars in CoCoNut using a simple binary tree structure, as presented
during the attribute grammar workshop.

Note that the AST is hardcoded into `src/main.c`.

To build the code, run `./configure.sh`.
